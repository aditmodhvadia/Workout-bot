# Exercise Chat Agent

This is a chatbot application aimed to create a conversational chat agent for people who are active and enjoy working out. 
The chat bot already consists of data within sqlLite, firebase, json files, and text files.

The current queries the user can make are:

* "How man steps have I taken on 27/5/2017?"
* "What type of activity did I do on 27/5/2017?"
* "What was my heart rate for 27/5/2017?"

Querying based on the date is somewhat tricky because it has to be parsed manually. 
You must enter the date in this format.
* DAY/MONTH/YEAR
* 12/11/2016
